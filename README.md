# Obfusicated-Code-Challenge
Hey! :)
Just open the Obfuscated.py file in your python IDE and run it. 
The  Obfuscated.py file requires only the stadard libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc.

You can also run the Obf_optional.py file.
Although you would need to "pip install pyarmor" if pyarmour isn't installed.
